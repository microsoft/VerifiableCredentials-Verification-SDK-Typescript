## Support for json-ld proofs
**Type of change:** new feature    
**Customer impact:** low

Creation of json-ld proofs is supported.
By default Jose signatures will be in the JWT format.

Add useJsonLdProofsProtocol to the JoseBuilder to support json-ld proofs:

          let jsonLdProofBuilder = new JoseBuilder(crypto)
            .useJsonLdProofsProtocol('JcsEd25519Signature2020')

For the moment only the JcsEd25519Signature2020 cipher suite is supported. See https://identity.foundation/JcsEd25519Signature2020/
